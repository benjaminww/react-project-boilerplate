# react-project-boilerplate
Simple React Project Setup using React, Webpack, and Babel.

## Features

* **React 16**
* **Webpack 4**
* **Babel 7**
* **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**

   HMR can speed up your development process tremendously. In simple terms, when you update your code locally, HMR detects your changes and automatically updates your app--you don't even need to refresh the browser.

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/benjaminww/react-project-boilerplate.git`
* cd react-project-boilerplate
* npm install
* npm run dev
* visit `http://localhost:8080/`

   If port 8080 on your computer is already in-use, the app will automatically try for a different port. Check your terminal to see which port your app is being hosted on.
